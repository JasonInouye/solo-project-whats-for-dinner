# What's For Dinner

What's For Dinner is a recipe app that has functionality to plan your meals out for the week. It allows the user to store the ingredients that they have in their house. WFD also allows you to perform 2 search types. A traditional search by ingredient/food type or you can also do a comprehensive search on all of the ingredients you have in your house. 

### Description

What's for Dinner uses a traditional search engine where the user can input a search by ingredient, food type, etc. 

WFD also allows the user to input and manage your ingredients in three different repositories listed below:

- Refrigerator
- Pantry
- Spices

Storing your ingredients in the app will provide you with an alternate search option that will return recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. Prioritizing the recipes with a 100% match. This search feature allows the user to be more impulsive when deciding on what's for dinner.

### Future Releases

Once you have made your meal plan for the week, I want to create a function that will create a shopping list of ingredients you might be missing. The ingredients needed for the week will cross reference the ingredients you currently have and output a shopping list of ingredients that you are missing.
