# What's For Dinner

Whatâ€™s For Dinner? will keep track of your ingredients in your house, help you plan dinner for the week and provide two recipe search methods. The first is a traditional search by ingredient (ex. ground beef) or by food type (ex. tacos). The second search method will return recipes based on your current ingredient inventory. 

### Description

What's for Dinner uses a traditional search engine where the user can input a search by ingredient, food type, etc. 

WFD also allows the user to input and manage your ingredients in three different repositories listed below:

- Refrigerator
- Pantry
- Spices

Storing your ingredients in the app will provide you with an alternate search option that will return recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. Prioritizing the recipes with a 100% match. This search feature allows the user to be more impulsive when deciding on what's for dinner.

### Future Releases

Once you have made your meal plan for the week, I want to create a function that will create a shopping list of ingredients you might be missing. The ingredients needed for the week will cross reference the ingredients you currently have and output a shopping list of ingredients that you are missing.  

### Usage

1. On the login screen. Click register in order to create a new user.

3. Input your ingredients using on of the links on the side bar (Refrigerator, Pantry, Spices).
4. "What's For Dinner?" link will take you to the search page. Here are two methods of searching. You can search by ingredient or food type.
